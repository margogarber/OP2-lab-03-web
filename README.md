# OP2-lab-03-web
created a web app 
to calculate this func like a + b = c
we are have a to variables like "a" and "b"
our task to find all values of "c"
from: "#" to: "#"
we also can using steps "#"
for example, we got:
a:
from "1" to "10" with a step "3"
and we are got:
b:
from "2" to "11" with a step "2"

so our output will look like this:
it's a table of all the calculation
everything under the letter "a" is the value of "a", the same for other letters
(a)	(b)	(c = a + b)
